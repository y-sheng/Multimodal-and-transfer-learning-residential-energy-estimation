# Multimodal and transfer learning residential energy estimation
This is the repository of python scripts used in the thesis by Yulan Sheng, titled as 'A Multimodal and Transfer Learning Approaches to Residential Building Operational Energy Estimation'.

The repository is structured as follows:<br>
|-Data <br>
|&emsp;|-Data collection and preprocessing<br>
|&emsp;|&emsp;|-Tabular data (filtering, aggregation)<br>
|&emsp;|&emsp;|-Image data<br>
|&emsp;|&emsp;|&emsp;|-GSV data<br>
|&emsp;|&emsp;|&emsp;|- Image data preprocess (data link, YOLOv5, watershed segmentation)<br>
|-Modelling<br>
|&ensp;|&emsp;|-Preliminary study: residential energy consumption prediction from tabular data<br>
|&ensp;|&emsp;|-Multimodal deep learning energy prediction from EPC and Google Streetview<br>
|&ensp;|&emsp;|-Transfer learning based efficient residential energy estimation for regions with limited data<br>
